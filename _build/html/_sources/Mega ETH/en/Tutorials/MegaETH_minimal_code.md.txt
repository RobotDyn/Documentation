Minimal code
==========

The minimal valid code to run on Mega 2560 ETH has the following structure:

```cpp

void setup() {
  // code that you put here will run exactly once, at startup

}

void loop() {
  // code that you put here will run repeatedly until power off or reset to run repeatedly:

}
```

Every line that starts with "//" is ignored by the compiler, so you can put any descriptions and comments in the code where you need them.
