# Online Graph Using Mega 3560 ETH Web Server with No External Services

In the following example, we will create a sketch that turns your Mega
ETH board to a Web Server that serves a graphical representation of a valure provided by a connected sensor (light sensor for this example). Since microcontroller resources are very limited, it is a common practice to use additional web services for more complex tasks like graphical representation of information. But if we don't want to depend on an external service, free or commercial, we might want to try to implement everything using nothing but the board, which is actually possible.

## Connecting a Sensor

We connect a photoresistor to 5V, GND and A0 pins of Mega 2560 ETH in such a way that the minimum light intensity is zero, while the maximum is 1024.

## Preparing the Web Page on SD Card

Let's create a simple HTML page and store it on an SD card using your
computer and a card reader. While you can use almost any text editor to
write HTML code, it will be much easier if it can highlight the HTML
syntaxis and automatically close HTML tags. Geany (geany.org) is an
example of such an editor available on almost all operating systems.
Create the following web page in the editor:

``` {.sourceCode .HTML}

Preparing the sketch
--------------------

Our sketch will be placed in EEPROM and will make use of 2 extra libraries: [EEPROMAnything](http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/EEPROMWriteAnything) and [Time library](http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/Time).

```cpp
/* ************************************************************************
 * ***            Super Graphing Data Logger - EEPROM config            ***
 * ************************************************************************
 * Everett Robinson, December 2012.
 *
 * The following extra non standard libraries were used, and will need to be
 * added to the libraries folder:
 * - EEPROMAnything:  http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/EEPROMWriteAnyt...
 *
 * This sketch helps you set the values in EEPROM which are necessary for
 * Super Graphing Data Logger. It should only need the be run once before
 * the first time you set up SGDL, or in the unlikely event that the EEPROM
 * becomes corrupted.
 *
 * Please ensure that the values in configuration config are appropriate for
 * your project before uncommenting the EEPROM_writeAnything(0, config); line.
 *
 */
 
#include <EEPROM.h>
#include <EEPROMAnything.h>
 
typedef struct{
    unsigned long newFileTime;
    char workingFilename[19];
  } configuration;
 
//This is a one off thing, so everything is in setup
void setup(){
  Serial.begin(9600);
   
  //Create the config struct to write to EEPROM, change values as appropriate
  //Make sure your filename is not too long for the workingFilename char array 
  configuration config = {1356912000L,"/data/25-12-12.csv"};
  //Write the values to the EEPROM
  //EEPROM_writeAnything(0, config);       //Uncomment when you're sure everything is correct
  configuration config2;                   //Create a second config struct for verification
  EEPROM_readAnything(0,config2);
  Serial.print("The value read from EEPROM for newFileTime is: ");
  Serial.println(config2.newFileTime);
  Serial.print("The value read from EEPROM for workingFilename is: ");
  Serial.println(config2.workingFilename);
  Serial.println("If those values are correct then everything went as planned. Otherwise,");
  Serial.println("please double check that the values declared for the struct config are");
  Serial.println("correct and that that EEPROM_writeAnything line is uncommented.");
}
 
 
void loop(){
}
```
Please mind the commented line `//EEPROM_writeAnything(0, config);` - uncomment itwhen you are sure that everything is correct.


## The main sketch

You will need to do a few adjustments to the code, like MAC and IP addresses. You can also adjust the timeserver address to your liking.

The code is set up to make measurements every 10 minutes, and to create a new datafile every week. Data files use a dd-mm-yy.csv format.

```cpp
/* ************************************************************************
 * ***                    Super Graphing Data Logger                    ***
 * ************************************************************************
 * Everett Robinson, December 2012. More at:  http://everettsprojects.com
 *
 * This sketch relies on the SD and ethernet libraries in arduino 1.0 or newer.
 * The following extra non standard libraries were also used, and will need to
 * be added to the libraries folder:
 * - Time:  http://everettsprojects.com
 * - EEPROMAnything:  http://everettsprojects.com
 *
 * If this is your first time setting up this project, please go get the
 * EEPROM_config sketch from  http://everettsprojects.com so that you can 
 * configure the config struct in the EEPROM memory. Usage of the EEPROM 
 * is needed to make the project resiliant against a temporary loss of power.
 *
 * You must also ensure that you have the HC.htm file in the root directory
 * of your SD card, as well as a data directory where the datafiles will be
 * stored.
 *
 * This sketch combines the functionality of an existing fileserver example
 * which can be found at  http://everettsprojects.com
 * with the Datalogger example that comes with the new SD library from 1.0,
 * as well as some code from the UdpNtpClient example that cones with the
 * ethernet library. 
 *
 * Added to all of these are some tricks to make it manage and serve up the
 * datafiles in conjunction with a page which uses highcharts JS to graph it.
 * This is basically accomplished using the arduino by itself. Because I
 * actually host the highcharts.js files externally, this is true more in
 * theory than in actual practice, but oh well. It should work just fine to
 * have the highcharts.js file on the arduino's SD card, though loading the 
 * page will be painfully slow.
 *
 * Some of the code this was derived from may or may not be under a GPL
 * licence; I'm not entirely sure. I suppose anyone using this should treat 
 * it like it is too, but I don't really care too much.
 * Also if one intends to use this for commercial applications, it may be
 * necessary to purchase a license for Highcharts.
 *
 * Changes:   -------------------------------------------------------------
 * January 2013: Updated so that the dd-mm-yy.csv file format is properly 
 * followed, all single digit days, months, and years will have a leading 
 * zero now.

## The Results

We will need to configure the pin 4 for the SD card reader to work, then
we initialize the network library, generate a presumably unique MAC
address following our previous recommendations of setting the first byte
of MAC address to 0xDE for better network equipment compatibility and
store that MAC address in the microcontroller's EEPROM.

We will use DHCP to query an available IP address from the network
router and display the IP address on a 16x2 LCD monitor because we need
to type that IP address into a browser, that must be running on a
computer on the same local network.

We assume that the HTML file is already stored on the SD card and the
card is inserted into the onboard card reader.

Let's get down to the code:

    #include <SPI.h>
    #include <Ethernet3.h>
    #include <EEPROM.h>
    #include <LiquidCrystal.h>
    #include <SD.h>

    byte mac[6] = { 0xDE, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00 };
    char macstr[18];

    // initialize the LCD library with the numbers of the interface pins
    LiquidCrystal lcd(12, 11, 5, 4, 3, 2);

    EthernetServer server(80);  // create a server at port 80

    void setup() {

      lcd.begin(16, 2); //Initialize the 16x2 LCD screen

      // Check EEPROM byte with offset==0 for “#” char. The presence of “#” in the first byte of EEPROM will be a sign that the MAC address was already generated and stored in bytes 1-7 of EEPROM. Otherwise, we need to generate a random MAC, put “#” at offset 0 and the MAC in the following 6 bytes
      if (EEPROM.read(0) == '#') {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 6; i++) {
          mac[i-1] = EEPROM.read(i);
        }
      } else {
        randomSeed(analogRead(0));
        mac[0] = 0xde;
        EEPROM.write(1, mac[0]);
        for (int i = 1; i < 6; i++) {
          mac[i] = random(0, 255);
          EEPROM.write(i+1, mac[i]);
        }
        EEPROM.write(0, '#');
      }

      // Startup networking, get IP, DNS, and subnet from the DHCP server

      if (Ethernet.begin(mac) == 0) {
        if (Ethernet.linkStatus() == LinkOFF) {
          lcd.print("LINK FAILURE");
          exit()
        }

                exit(0)
        }
      } else // success, display your local IP address:
             lcd.print(Ethernet.localIP()); //You can enter this IP in your web browser
    }

    void loop() {

            while (client.connected()) {
                if (client.available()) {   // client data available to read
                    char c = client.read(); // read 1 byte (character) from client
