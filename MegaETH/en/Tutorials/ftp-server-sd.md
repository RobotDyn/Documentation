# FTP Server using SD Card

Being a fully-capable network device, RobotDyn Mega 2560 ETH can even act as a simple but fully functional FTP server, storing files to and serving from an SD card.

The FTP server is created by Github user galledojm ([https://github.com/gallegojm](https://github.com/gallegojm)).

You can find full code as well as instructions on [Github](https://github.com/gallegojm/Arduino-Ftp-Server/tree/master/FtpServer).
